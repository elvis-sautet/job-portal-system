                visitors to the
                Site (referred to in this policy as “we”, “us” or “our”). “Cookies” are text-only pieces of
                information
                that a website transfers to an individual’s hard drive or other website-browsing equipment for
                record-keeping purposes. Cookies allow the Site to remember important information that will make
                your
                use of the site more convenient. A cookie will typically contain the name of the domain from which
                the
                cookie has come, the “lifetime” of the cookie, and a randomly generated unique number or other
                value.
                Certain cookies will be used on the Site regardless of whether you are logged in to your account or
                not.
                Session Cookies are temporary cookies that remain in the cookie file of your browser until you leave

                depend on the lifetime of the specific cookie). When we use session cookies to track the total number of
                visitors to our Site, this is done on an anonymous aggregate basis (as cookies do not in themselves
                carry any personal data). We may also employ cookies so that we remember your computer when it is used
                to return to the Site to help customize your <?php echo $Company_name?> web experience. We may associate
